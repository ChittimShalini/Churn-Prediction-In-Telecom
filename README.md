# Churn Prediction in the Telecom Industry
## Overview

Churn Prediction is a crucial task for companies with subscription-based services. This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. By identifying customers who are likely to leave, telecom companies can implement targeted retention strategies to improve customer loyalty and reduce turnover.

## Project Description
This project utilizes historical customer data to predict the likelihood of churn. The dataset includes various customer attributes and service usage metrics. The goal is to build a predictive model that helps in identifying customers who are at risk of canceling their services.

## Key Features
* Customer Demographics: Information such as age, gender, and seniority.
  
* Account Information: Tenure, monthly charges, and total charges.
  
* Service Usage: Details on service usage, including internet and phone services.
  
* Customer Feedback: Insights from customer interactions and complaints.

## Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
- Objective: Predict the probability of a customer churning based on historical data.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

## Data Preparation
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that contribute to churn prediction.
Train-Test Split: Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Results and Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting churn. Visualizations and metrics are provided to analyze the model's effectiveness and the importance of various features in predicting customer churn.
